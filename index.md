Other things you need: 
 - Coffee beans

### **Normal vs. Inverted AeroPress** 
You can prepare a coffee in AeroPress in two ways.

**Normal/Upright** 

If you are a beginner, start with this method. This is the original way of how you can brew a coffee.
- Attach the Filter Cap to the Chamber
- Put the AeroPress on the cup with the Filter Cap end directed downwards
- Add a coffee and water according to the recipe
- When the brewing is complete, attach the Plunger and press it to instill the coffee into the cup

![Normal method](./AeroPress-Original-Coffee-Maker_700x.jpg)

When you pour water it starts to drip through the filter immediately, which can cause less extraction of the coffee.

This method can be used when you are a new user of the AeroPress. It is slightly easier and safer to the beginners than the Inverted method.


**Inverted**

- Join the Chamber and the Plunger together
- Set the rubber end of the Plunger on number 4 on the Chamber scale
- Put the AeroPress on a flat surface with the Filter Cap end directed upwards
- Add a coffee and water according to the recipe
- After a stirring attach the Filter Cap with filters to the Chamber
- When the brewing is complete flip the AeroPress, put it on the cup with a Filter Cap end directed downwards and press it to instill the coffee into the cup

![Inverted method](./inverted_aeropress.jpeg)

This method allows you to brew a coffee for as long as you want because the coffee doesn't drip through the filter while brewing. When you flip the AeroPress, the grinds become fully saturated. For the safety reasons be careful when you flip the AeroPress. Please see  [Safety notices](##Safety-notices) 

### **Brewing**
This instruction is for the **Inverted AeroPress** method
1. Measure 15 grams of coffee
2. Grind coffee beans fine or coarse, depending on what flavor you want to get (refer to playing with flavor section)
3. Put 2 paper filters into the Filter Holder
4. Wet the paper filters
5. Put a scoop of coffee into AeroPress
6. Pour 85-90 grams of hot water (95 degrees) 
7. Stir a coffee for 10 seconds
8. Wait 30 seconds
9. Flip Aerpress and put it on the cup
10. Press gently for 20-45 seconds untill you hear a hissing sound. Your coffee concentate is ready. Add hot water based on your preferences

### **Cleaning**

Cleaning AeroPress couldn't be easier. You need to press the Plunger all the way and the coffee grounds will drop. After it is done you can just brush AeroPress under the running water. From time to time you can wash it with a dish soap.


## **3. Playing with a flavor**

With AeroPress you can produce numerous flavors of your coffee. The taste of the coffee depends on the *coffee grind, water temperature, extraction time, agitation, and amount of coffee used*. The taste of your coffee can differ in extraction - can be more bitter or more acid. Less extraction means the taste has more acidity, while more extraction means it tastes more bitter. The best way to find your favorite taste is to experiment. Below you see that the taste changes depending on the given factors. The guide does not provide the exact range for these factors as it depends on your judgement.

|            | Less extraction | More extraction |
|------------|----|-----------------|
| Grinding |	coarse	      | fine             |
|Temperature |	lower		|		 	higher|
|Stirring	|gentle			|		strong				
Extraction time |	shorter	|				longer
Coffee amount|	more coffee	|			less coffee



## **3. Safety notices**

Make sure the Filer Cap is strongly attached to the Chamber to prevent it from dropping out. 

In Inverted AeroPress make sure the Plunger is attached to the Chamber before pouring a hot water.

In Normal AeroPress make sure a Filter Cap is attached to the Chamber before pouring a hot water.

When you flip the AeroPress hold the Chamber with one hand and the Plunger with the other hand to prevent them from splitting caused by air pressure. When the AeroPress is on the cup hold the cup with one hand and the AeroPress with another.

Never press hard. It can result in a breakage and spills.
